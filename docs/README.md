# Documentation Directory

This directory contains project documentation, historical records, and development guides.

## Contents

- **SECURITY_FIX_RCE.md**: Historical documentation of RCE vulnerability fix in JavaScript parser
- Future documentation files will be added here

## Purpose

This directory organizes supplementary documentation that provides context and historical records but is not needed for initial project setup. For primary documentation, see the root directory:

- Root README.md: Project overview and usage guide
- Root SECURITY.md: Security policy and reporting guidelines
- Root INSTALL.md: Installation instructions
- Root CLAUDE.md: Claude Code project instructions (must stay in root for automatic discovery)

## Contributing Documentation

When adding new documentation:
- Use clear, descriptive filenames
- Add entries to this README.md
- Keep root directory documentation for user-facing content only
- Place developer/historical docs here
